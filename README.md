# Hi there 👋, I'm [Your Name]

### 🩺 Physician & 💻 Computer Scientist
**Bridging the gap between In Vivo complexity and In Silico precision.**

---

I am a dual-qualified professional combining clinical medical expertise with advanced software engineering. My work focuses on High-Performance Computing (HPC) applied to computational biology, aiming to solve complex physiological problems using GPU-accelerated simulations and Artificial Intelligence.

### 🧬 Currently Working On: **Digital-Twin Framework**

I am architecting a high-performance simulation engine designed to model biological systems across multiple scales—from molecular reactions and cell signaling to tissue mechanics and organ function.

> This framework acts as a comprehensive **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Gym**, creating a closed-loop system where multi-scale biological simulations are continuously validated and fine-tuned using real-world data obtained from laboratory experiments.
